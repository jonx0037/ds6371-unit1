          <p>What is the difference between a randomized experiment and a random sample? Under what type of study/sample can a causal inference be made?</p>

                <li>A random sample is when units are randomly selected from a population to participate in a study. This allows for generalization to the broader population.</li>
                
                <li>A randomized experiment is when subjects (who may or may not have been randomly sampled) are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. This controls for confounding variables.</li>
                
                <li>Causal inference can only be made from randomized experiments because random assignment creates groups that are probabilistically similar in all ways except for the treatment.</li>

          <p>In 1936, the Literary Digest polled 1 out of every 4 Americans and concluded that Alfred Landon would win the presidential election in a landon-slide (pun intended:). Of course, history turned out dramatically different. The magazine combined three sampling sources: subscribers to its magazine, phone number records, and automobile registration records. Comment on the desired population of interest of the survey and what population the magazine actually drew from.</p>

                <li>Desired Population: All eligible American voters in 1936</li>
                
                <li>Actual Population Sampled: Americans who were:
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li>Magazine subscribers (likely higher income/education)</li>

                    <li>Car owners (another luxury in 1936)</li>

                </li>
                
                <li>Key Issue: Severe sampling bias

                    <li>All three sources oversampled wealthy Americans</li>
                    <li>During Great Depression, wealth strongly correlated with political views</li>
