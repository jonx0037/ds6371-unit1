                <li>A random sample is when units are randomly selected from a population to participate in a study. This allows for generalization to the broader population.</li>
                
                <li>A randomized experiment is when subjects (who may or may not have been randomly sampled) are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. This controls for confounding variables.</li>
                
                <li>Causal inference can only be made from randomized experiments because random assignment creates groups that are probabilistically similar in all ways except for the treatment.</li>
